# Primordial Globular Cluster formation
This code is to study Primordial Globular Clusters (pGCs) formation in Dark Matter Halos

The original version of this code is in Parkinson et. al. 2008 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.383..557P/abstract)

Here we modify the code with our conditions of DM which can form pGCs, and then get the number of pGCs (*.f90 files).
