# GCs
This code is to study how Primordial Globular Clusters (GCs) formed in Dark Matter Halos

The original version of this code is proposed in Parkinson et. al. 2008
Here we modify it to count number of GCs form in DM halos (*.f90 files).

The *.ipynb files deal with data from Harris 2013, Yang et. al 2021 catalogs, to compare to theoretical results.
